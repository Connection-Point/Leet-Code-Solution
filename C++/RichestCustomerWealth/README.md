# Code Explanation

```C++
class solution{
    public:
        int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) 
        {
            int i,j,
            m = accounts.size(),
            n = accounts[0].size(),
            MaxWealth = 0, 

            for(i=0; i<m; i++;)
            {
                int Wealth = 0;
                for(j=0;j<n;j++)
                {
                    Wealth += accounts[i][j];
                }
                if(Wealth > MaxWealth)
                {
                    MaxWealth = Wealth;
                }
            }

            return MaxWealth;
        }
};


This code is a function called `maximumWealth()` that takes a 2D array of integers as input and returns the maximum wealth of any individual in the array. The 2D array represents the wealth of each individual, where each row represents an individual and each column represents a different asset.

The function works by first declaring a few variables:

* `i` and `j`: These are loop variables that are used to iterate through the 2D array.
* `m` and `n`: These variables represent the number of rows and columns in the 2D array, respectively.
* `MaxWealth`: This variable stores the maximum wealth of any individual.

The function then starts a loop that iterates through the rows of the 2D array. For each row, the function declares a variable called `Wealth` that stores the total wealth of the individual in that row. The function then iterates through the columns of the row and adds the value of each asset to the `Wealth` variable. If the `Wealth` variable is greater than the `MaxWealth` variable, then the `MaxWealth` variable is updated to the value of `Wealth`.

After the loop is finished, the function returns the value of the `MaxWealth` variable.

Here is an example of how the function would work:

python
accounts = [[1, 5, 0], [2, 4, 3], [2, 1, 0]]

maximumWealth(accounts)


This code would return the value 9, which is the maximum wealth of any individual in the `accounts` array.
